# linkedin-unshitify
Simple and customizable user script to unshitify LinkedIn.
- Removes addictive features.
- Removes features that don't belong on a proffesional website.
- Removes the infinite scroll feed entirely if you don't want to be distracted while responding to messages.
- Makes LinkedIn useful again.

Star if you find it useful, but I don't really care, just want to share the script, I use it for myself every day.

Can be installed using Tampermonkey on all modern desktop browsers: https://www.tampermonkey.net/   
Not recommended for people without a little bit of computer literacy, this can break things.
